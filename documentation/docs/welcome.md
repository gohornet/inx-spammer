# Welcome to INX-Spammer

INX-Spammer is a tool to generate transactions in the network thereby increasing reference and confirmation rates.

## Setup

The recommended setup is to use the provided [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/iotaledger/inx-spammer).
These images are also used in our [HORNET recommended setup using Docker](http://wiki.iota.org/hornet/develop/how_tos/using_docker).

## Configuration

You can find all the configuration options in the [configuration section](configuration.md).

## Dashboard

If you are using the [INX-Dashboard](https://github.com/iotaledger/inx-dashboard) on your node, you can control the spammer directly from your browser.

## Source Code
